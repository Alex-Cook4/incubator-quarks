Script for restarting Quarks if the JVM crashes

The startapp.sh script is setup to run as a cron job every minute in order
to monitor a JVM running a Quarks application and restart Quarks if the 
JVM crashes. The script checks whether the pid of the JVM indicates
a process which is still running.  If the pid is not there, it executes the 
command to start the application in the first place.

The JVM's standard output and standard error are written to the directory 
passed as a command line argument for the script. The script also saves the
process id (pid) of the JVM in a file.  If the pid file already exists and 
contains the id of a running process, then the script will not start Quarks.

The script is currently setup to execute the quarks.samples.topology.Terminated
sample, which throws an exception after processing a preset number of 
tuples.

The crontab entry file startapp.cron contains information which cron uses to
schedule the job. 

To setup the script to run as a cron job:

1. Edit the startapp.cron file:
 - Set the QUARKS environment variable to point to your quarks installation,
   for example: QUARKS=/home/your_userid/quarks-release/quarks/java8
 - Make sure java is in the path; cron provides a default PATH environment 
   variable which is probably different from the one you use for development.

2. Install startapp.cron: 

$ crontab ./startapp.cron

   Note: if you wish to have your ~/.profile executed you must explicitly
   do so in the crontab entry or in a script called by the entry.

3. To remove the current crontab entries:

$ crontab -r
